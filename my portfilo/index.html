    <marquee behavior="INFORMATION" direction="icon"></marquee> Coffee is one of the most popular beverages there is,
    with billions of cups enjoyed every year. Given that
    coffee is so well loved around the world, itâ€™s only natural for us to want to know more about our favourite brew

    <p>
        <mark> People most commonly drink coffee to increase mental alertness. Coffee is also used for diabetes, cancer,
            heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific
            evidence to support most of these uses.</mark>


        <br>

        <abbr> Coffea arabica </abbr>
        The scientific name for coffee is Coffea arabica. The bean is widely grown, fragile, and pest-prone. Arabica
        coffee beans differ from Robusta coffee beans(C. canephora) and these two species are responsible for the
        production of coffee around the world.

        <a> There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans. The story
            goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree,
            his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night.</a>

        <h1 style="border: 10px;"></h1>
        Overall, lighter roasts generally have less caffeine and more antioxidants than darker roasts. The type of bean
        can affect the caffeine content, but both Arabica and Robusta beans can give you the full health benefits of
        coffee.
